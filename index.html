	<h3>Kpop</h3>
	<p>K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop; Korean: 케이팝) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea.
	While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term Gayo (가요), which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea.
	Although it generally indicates &ldquo;popular music&rdquo; within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. 
	The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea&rsquo;s contemporary music scene.</p>

	<h3>21st Century: Rise of Hallyu</h3>
	<p>K-pop&rsquo;s increasing popularity forms part of Hallyu, or the Korean Wave: the popularity of South Korean culture in other countries.
	K-pop is increasingly making appearances on Western charts such as Billboard.
	The development of online social media has been a vital tool for the Korean music industry in reaching a wider audience.
	As part of the Korean Wave, K-pop has been embraced by the South Korean government as a tool for projecting South Korea&rsquo;s soft power abroad, particularly towards overseas youth.
	In August 2014, the prominent British news magazine The Economist dubbed Korean pop culture &ldquo;Asia&rsquo;s foremost trendsetter&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>By the beginning of the 21st century, the K-pop market had slumped and early K-pop idol groups that had seen success in the 90&rdquo;s were on the decline. H.O.T. disbanded in 2001, while other groups like Sechs Kies, S.E.S., Fin.K.L, Shinhwa, and g.o.d became inactive by 2005. 
	Solo singers like BoA and Rain grew in success. However, the success of boy band TVXQ after its debut in 2003 marked the resurgence of idol groups to Korean entertainment and the growth of K-pop as part of Hallyu. 
	The birth of second-generation K-pop was followed with the successful debuts of SS501 (2005), Super Junior (2005), Big Bang (2006), Wonder Girls (2007), Girls' Generation (2007), Kara (2007), Shinee (2008), 2NE1 (2009), 4Minute (2009), T-ara (2009), f(x) (2009), and After School (2009).</p>

	<h3>Kpop Lyrics Quotes</h3>
	<p>&ldquo;The only time you should ever look back, is to see how far you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo; <i> ― BTS, Butterfly</i></p>
	<p>&ldquo;Live your life. It&rsquo;s yours anyway. Don&rsquo;t try too hard. It&rsquo;s okay to lose.&rdquo; <i> ― BTS, Fire</i></p>
	<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing special. It can be your youth or anything else. 
	It can be a period of time where something big happens... 
	but the most beautiful time of your life is when you feel that moment truthfully with your heart, and you accept that moment. 
	Then from the time you were born until you die, your entire life can be beautiful.&rdquo; <i> ― Kim Nam-joon</i></p>
